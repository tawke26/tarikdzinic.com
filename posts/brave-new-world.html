            <div style="margin-top: 2rem;">
                <p>A utopian society that does everything to remain stable. People are not born, but artificially brought up in laboratories and present to one of the groups: epsilon, delta, gamma, beta, alpha. There are also pluses and minuses amongst the group, with the highest being alpha double plus. Each group is responsible for certain tasks, epsilons and deltas do the lowest class work. Gammas and betas do mostly production and reproduction-related works, while alphas and alpha pluses teach and keep the society functioning. Everyone is happy because everything is neatly organized, everyone knows their role, and society is programmed in a way to minimize free thoughts which is viewed as a destabilizer/destroyer of society. During the insinuations, embryos are purposefully exposed to oxygen shortage or "poisoned" with substances like alcohol: to create lower classes. At the same time, others are taken care of, to produce "higher ranks", a new class of leaders.<br><br>"We also predestine and condition. We decent our babies as socialized human beings, as Alphas or Epsilons, as future sewage workers or future… Word controllers."<br><br>Each rank measures themselves by observing the one below him. This way everyone feels they are the "lucky one", it could have been worse. The lowest rank is brain-dead. Everyone is happy with where they are. Whichever rank you might be you don't mind because you don't know how the one ranked above you feels. Only those who are alpha plus and double plus lean into forbiden: books, arts, religion, etc. <br><br>To condition embryos, children, and adults to utopia they play recordings of catchy rhymes during their sleep. Children are thought to take whatever satisfies them, including indulgence in erotic play. Adults think that everyone belongs to everyone. There is no friction and no struggle to have dopamin in that world.<br><br>Getting rid of everything unpleasant instead of learning to put up with it.<br><br>When things get difficult there is a drug called soma, which makes you forget whatever difficulty you have faced.<br><br>All of the conditioning is directed at making people like their unescapable social destiny.<br><br>People are also conditioned to fear anyone going outside of established belief systems. Everyone keeps everyone else at check. Having children, <strong>not</strong> indulging in sexual activity with everyone, or thinking unorthodoxly is viewed as bad. There are no morals in this world, what is wanted is given to those who want it.<br><br>When the individual feels the community reels.<br><br>No civilization without social stability. No social stability without individual stability.<br><br>Things such as art, beauty, and religion are completely suppressed by social conditioning, such as shocking babies, and by giving drugs and momentary dopamine experiences such as easily obtainable sex. Books are especially condemned because of the belief that individual might start thinking on their own. The fear of misaligning with the societal truth.<br><br>You can't make tragedies without social instability.<br><br>They'll grow up with what the psychologists used to call an "instinctive" hatred of books and flowers. Reflexes unalterably conditioned. They'll be safe from books an botany all their lives.<br><br>After all "a love of nature keeps no factories busy".<br><br>Knowledge was the highest good, truth the supreme value; all the rest was ordinary and subordinate. True, ideas were beginning to change even then. Our Ford himself did a great deal to shift the emphasise from truth and beauty to comfort and happiness. Mass production demanded the shift. Universal happiness keeps the wheels steadily turning; truth and beauty can't.<br><br>What I learned from the book:<br><br>Arts and freedom are what bring suffering - a necessary suffering. The one we must bear, to be truly free - to have choices.<br>The one who can express himself is deadly: "Words can be like X-rays if you use them properly - they'll go through anything. You speak and you pierce."<br>You can't write about something that doesn't grasp you: "Can you say something about nothing".<br>Human beings seem to gain a lot of satisfaction from handwork, which is expressive and artistic: "it was pure delight to be doing something that demanded skill and patience."<br>When two people decide to wait before having sex, their relationship deepens, as they allow each other for the lust to build up. That is one step towards Love.<br>Is it possible that God is incompatible with machinery and scientific medicine and universal happiness: "Well he manifests himself as an absence; as though he weren't there at all". People believe in God because they are conditioned to believe in God.</p>
