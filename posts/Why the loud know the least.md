The more you learn about something, the more you understand its complexity.
The limitations and details are intricate, and it's hard to explain them.

But when you don't know much, it's easy to form an opinion - Dunning-Kruger effect.

Socrates said: "I know that I know nothing."

Simplicity doesn't work. The world is too complex.
The loudest voices are often the ones that have no clue.

This does not mean we should not try to make things simpler.

But what it does mean is we should stop making judgments so lightly.

You don't need to have an opinion on everything.
